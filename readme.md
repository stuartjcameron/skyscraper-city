Skyscraper City

- Shoot your opponent's skyscraper and grow your own
- Climb up it and reach the cloud to win
- Your skyscraper grows from the bottom when you collect bricks
- (?) Bricks appear at random. You also get extra bricks when you shoot your opponents' tower.
- Controls: left / right. Up/down for stairs.
    - Ctrl to fire. Hold down Ctrl longer to fire further.
    - Up / down while holding Ctrl to change direction while firing
    - Release Ctrl to release the missile

Plan
- Tue:
    - Make skyscrapers that grow randomly, with blocks and staircases
    - Make characters that can run up the skyscrapers

- Wed:
    - Shooting mechanism
    - Shooting damages the skyscrapers
- Thu:
    - Design computer's tactics for 1P mode
- Fri:
    - Make sprites and effects
    - Add sound

If time:
    - Collecting bricks makes the skyscrapers grow (or grow faster)
    - Alternative weapons cause more damage
